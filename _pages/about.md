Work experience
======
* Summer 2024: Intern in University of Michigan, Ann Arbor
  * Lead the ML for scientific application project in Qing's group, the main project is to use the generative models to model and predict chaotic dynamic systems like fluids and use it to solve real-world problems, we primarily focus on the data assimilation task.
  * Introduce the current research projects in various seminars and symposiums, like IMSI workshop, CSP seminar etc.
